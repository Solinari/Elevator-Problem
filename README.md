Elevator-Problem
================

Simulate an elevator system.

A friend recommended I try this problem, and I've chosen to represent it graphically. 

Because of this, this is a work in progress as I continue to implement features and changes.

I started by created an Elevator Object, taking inputs from the user, then using a list comprehension

to represent the entire "building"

My next step in this project is to apply a Canvas GUI to display the text representation of my data

Then update the canvas as the elevators move as patrons push buttons. thus simulating the elevator system

I also need to implement a on_text_update() method within the canvas class and resizing elements.

sample output:

```1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10    
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  0  
E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  E  0```
